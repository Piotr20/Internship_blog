               <h3>Week 1:</h3>
               <p>
                    I started my internship on 2nd week of January because of corona Duckwise encourages their employees
                    to self-quarantine for one week. I thought that after quarantine I would be able to work from the
                    office but because of restrictions that are still going tighter and tighter majority of my
                    internship is going to be from home with casual day at office. During the first day I had a nice
                    talk with my supervisor Petr who is a BAAA absolvent of Web development course. We also set up some
                    stuff for React and WordPress.
                    My first task was to combine API with the frontend using React components. I felt lost in it because
                    even though I took some courses in React before the internship the structure in this project is much
                    more complicated then in the courses. I got a week to do that and supervision of Petr every time I
                    need it. I have done it by Thursday, and we sent It to our UX designer to approve it or implement
                    some feedback to that.

               </p>
               <h3>Week 2:</h3>
               <p>
                    At the beginning of this week, I got some feedback from our UX designers and had some time to
                    implement it until we have a talk with the clients on Tuesday that I am joining. The meeting went
                    well client had also some feedback so after the talk I had like one day to implement slight changes
                    to the functionality.
                    After that I was introduced to another case for non-profit organisation that I would do on my own.
                    They website is currently down and they new temporary website. I am kind of excited for that since
                    it’s a project on my own so I can show some of my skills.
               </p>
               <h3>Week 3:</h3>
               <p>
                    At the beginning of this week, I got introduced to another project. It turned out to be one of the
                    biggest projects that I will be doing. The project is going to take around 3 months and after that
                    it is going to be continued. The company is big danish company of international size and they need
                    top-notch website like from awwards.com. I like that I can try working on multiple projects at once
                    and see how it works for me.
                    The project from last week got sent for the client and I am waiting for some feedback from them.
                    There is some problems with setting it up online because of clients set up on server, I was sceptic
                    to the WordPress because there is not much coding in there bur It turned out to be nice and easy.

               </p>
               <h3>Week 4:</h3>
               <p>
                    We are still struggling with client set up of the non-profit organisation so until we solve it our
                    focus goes to the Siguna project. We used Gatsby, Tailwind, Sanity or Sass so there is lots of new
                    stuff in there for me to incorporate in my toolbox; Sometimes because there is so much new stuff, I
                    feel like I can not show all of my skills, but I am optimistic that when I learn the stuff we are
                    using at Duckwise I can be a valuable part of the team. -With a help of my supervisor, we set up the
                    environment and fetched some of the data from Sanity CMS. The task I finished the week with was
                    creating the navigation for the website using CMS and Gatsby but I didn’t exactly managed to finish
                    that.
